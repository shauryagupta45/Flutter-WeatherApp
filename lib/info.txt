Now , what's the use of async process
let's say we write

step 1 : print("hello moon")
step 2 : syncload( load image from nasa)
step 3 : print ("hello jupiter")

now when we have ewritten sync, we find that step 3 takes place after completion of step 2 only,
while in asynch, step 3 is implemented, irrespective of completion of step 2, meanwhile step 2 is loading , step 3 can be implemented

Now what is the advantage of async now ?
